   - **Edge Cases**:
     - **Login**:
       - Test login with special characters in username or password.
     - **Filtering**:
       - Apply multiple filters simultaneously and verify correct results.
     - **Product Listing Page**:
       - Verify sorting and pagination features.
     - **Product Details Page**:
       - Validate product page URL changes with product selection.
     - **Cart**:
       - Test adding/removing items rapidly.
     - **Checkout**:
       - Test with varying quantities and product types.

**2. **Cross-Browser Testing**

   - **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
   - **Objective**: Verify that the application performs consistently across these browsers.
   - **Tools**: Use Playwright's built-in support for cross-browser testing.

**3. **Viewport Testing**

   - **Viewport Sizes**: 
     - Desktop: 1280x1024, 1920x1080
     - Tablet: 768x1024
     - Mobile: 375x667, 414x896
   - **Objective**: Ensure the application is responsive and displays correctly on various screen sizes.

**4. **Network Conditions**

   - **Scenarios**: 
     - Test with different network speeds (e.g., 3G, 4G, LTE)
     - Test in offline mode to ensure proper handling of network loss.
   - **Objective**: Verify the application’s performance and behavior under different network conditions.

**5. **Critical Flows**

   - **Login Process**: Ensure the user can log in successfully and handle failed login attempts.
   - **Product Purchase**: Complete the end-to-end purchase process including adding items to the cart and checking out.
   - **Error Handling**: Validate the application’s handling of errors, such as invalid input or network failures.

**6. Integration Testing**

   - **Third-Party Logistics**:
     - **Integration Points**: 
       - Ensure seamless data exchange between the e-commerce application and the logistics system (e.g., order details, shipping status).
     - **Error Handling**:
       - Test how the application handles errors from the logistics system (e.g., failed order submissions, delayed shipping updates).
       - Verify that appropriate user notifications or error messages are displayed.

**7. Performance Testing**

   - **Load Testing**:
     - Simulate a high number of concurrent users to evaluate the application’s performance under load.
     - Monitor response times, server resource utilization, and application behavior.

   - **Stress Testing**:
     - Test the application beyond its maximum load to determine breaking points.
     - Identify how the application recovers from extreme conditions.

   - **Performance Testing**:
     - Measure response times for key functionalities (e.g., page load times, checkout process).
     - Evaluate the impact of various factors (e.g., large product catalogs, complex filtering).

**8. Regression Testing**

   - **Areas for Regression**:
     - **Login**: Verify that login functionality remains unaffected by recent changes.
     - **Product Filtering**: Ensure that filtering and sorting functionality still works correctly.
     - **Cart Management**: Test adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.
     - **Checkout**: Confirm that the checkout process is intact and all payment options function correctly.
     - **UI Changes**: Validate that recent UI changes do not affect existing functionalities.
